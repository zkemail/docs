# ZK Email SDK

ZK EMAIL DOCS HAVE MOVED TO [docs.zk.email](https://docs.zk.email). THE FOLLOWING DOCS ARE OUTDATED.

You can use the the ZK Email SDK and Registry to easily define a new ZK Email app in just an 8 line JSON. You can see existing proofs, add new ones, and try them out at [sdk.prove.email](https://sdk.prove.email/).
