### 2024 Audit by zksecurity

We completed a second audit in May 2024 of [all of our ZK circuits](https://github.com/zkemail/zk-email-verify), including our latest ZK regex rewrite. The audit deemed that EmailVerifier was safe, but people using sub-components in custom circuits may require extra changes and validations. We have fixed all of the high/medium issues, and you can see the full report here and use the fixed circuits via using version 6.1.1 from npm.

Fixes committed at [95cd90](https://github.com/zkemail/zk-email-verify/commit/95cd90) for zk-email-verify

Fixes committed at [5396ec](https://github.com/zkemail/zk-regex/commit/5396ec) for zk-regex
